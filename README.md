## Overview

This repository demonstrates the development of machine learning models that estimate house prices based on various input features. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and result visualization within interactive notebooks.

## Features

- In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of housing data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R²
- Visualization of results and feature importances
- End-to-end reproducible workflow in Jupyter Notebooks

## Tech Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook** (100% of codebase)
- **Python** (via the notebook kernel)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyansh-dhawan/House-Price-Prediction.git
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   If a `requirements.txt` is provided:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Otherwise, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the desired notebook file to start exploring.

## Usage

- Open any notebook (`.ipynb`) file to view the step-by-step workflow.
- Follow the cells sequentially to reproduce results or modify them for experimentation.
- You can use your own dataset by replacing the sample data and adjusting preprocessing as needed.
